The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### 📋 Requirements

**Users should be able to:**

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### 💡 Ideas to test myself

- Write the styles using a CSS pre-processor like Sass, Less, or Stylus
- Train my eye for detail by matching the solution to the design
- Try estimating the time it will take to build the project and compare with actual time
- Use testing tools to validate and improve the quality of the code

### 🔍 Resources

- [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) – For testing across browsers
- [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) – HTML validation
- [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) – CSS validation

### ⏱️ Time Taken

**Estimated Time:**

- 60m for search and reviewing the design
- 240m for coding
- 60m for testing, adjustments, and writing the README

**Actual Time:**

- 53m – Search and review
- 13m – Initial setup
