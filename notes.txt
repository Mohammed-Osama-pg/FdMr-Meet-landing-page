# Meet landing page
## What the challenge ?
    challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## What it requires ?
    My users should be able to:
    - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for interactive elements

## Ideas to test myself ?
    - Write the styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus.
    - Train my eye for detail by getting my solution as close to the design as I can.
    - Try estimating the time it will take for me to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to my estimate.
    - Using testing tools to test my code.

## Search and resources? 
    Using testing tool as [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) and [validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea).
    For normall HTML and CSS testing I use [Nu HTML checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)and [W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## The Time is take to finsh this project:
    - My estimating: 
    + 60m  = for Search and Review the design.
    + 240m = for coding the project.
    + 60m  = to test and changes and readme file.

    - The real time:
    + 53m  = for Search and Review the design.
    + 13m
    + 59m
    + 42m
    + 74m
    + 75m
    + 83m
    + 20m
    + 15m = check for errors
